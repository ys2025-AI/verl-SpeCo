# verl-SpeCo: Co-Train to Accelerate RL and Inference

`verl-SpeCo` is a lightweight SPECO drafter-training overlay for
[verl](https://github.com/verl-project/verl). It keeps upstream `verl` as an
import-only dependency and adds speculative decoding drafter collection,
training, and hot-update logic through `verl_speco`.

## Highlights

- **Import-only verl overlay**: composes upstream `verl` PPO/GRPO config and
  runs through `python -m verl_speco.main` without patching the installed `verl`
  tree.
- **Drafter Co-Training in the RL loop**: collects hidden states during rollout or
  old-logprob computation, trains a drafter periodically, and publishes updated
  drafter weights back to the rollout engine.
- **Multiple drafter backends**: includes EAGLE-1, EAGLE-2, EAGLE3, DFlash,
  DSpark, Domino, and P-EAGLE trainer backends under `verl_speco.backends`.
- **vLLM and SGLang integration**: supports EAGLE-1, EAGLE-2, EAGLE3, DFlash,
  DFlash2, and DSpark speculative decoding on vLLM, plus EAGLE3 and DFlash on SGLang,
  with drafter collection and hot-update logic integrated through the rollout
  engine.
- **GPU and NPU examples**: provides example scripts for vLLM, SGLang, and
  vLLM-Ascend style graph settings.
- **FSDP2 and VeOmni actors**: keeps the drafter trainer on FSDP2 while the
  main actor can use verl's FSDP/FSDP2 or VeOmni model engine.
- **Step-level observability**: exposes drafter timing and vLLM speculative
  decoding acceptance metrics, including
  `drafter/spec_decode/mean_acceptance_length`.

## Architecture

![verl-SpeCo architecture](docs/assets/speco-architecture.svg)

For the online drafter collection, training, and publish scheduling boundary,
including how to add a new execution or collection strategy, see the
[Drafter Scheduler guide](docs/drafter_scheduler.md).

## Performance Preview

The current results focus on EAGLE3 with the vLLM rollout engine, where
verl-SpeCo supports both GPU and NPU deployments. The figures below show a
Qwen3-8B EAGLE3 run on vLLM-Ascend/NPU; DFlash support is available, and DFlash
figures will be added in a later update.

On Qwen3-8B with an EAGLE3 drafter on vLLM-Ascend/NPU, a 100-step run shows
that co-training increases mean acceptance length over the fixed-drafter setting
and, compared with the baseline, delivers about 20% faster rollout and 11%
faster end-to-end training without accuracy regression.

## Draft Model Support

| Draft model | Rollout engines | Training engine | Status |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| EAGLE-1 | vLLM | FSDP | Available |
| EAGLE-2 | vLLM | FSDP | Available |
| EAGLE3 | vLLM, SGLang | FSDP | Available |
| DFlash | vLLM, SGLang | FSDP | Available |
| DFlash2 | vLLM via DFlash, SGLang via DFLASH | FSDP | Available |
| DSpark | vLLM | FSDP | Available |
| Domino | vLLM, SGLang via DFlash | FSDP | Available |
| P-EAGLE | Not wired in this overlay | FSDP | Training only |

EAGLE-1 and EAGLE-2 share vLLM's native EAGLE draft method; EAGLE-2 adds the
dynamic-tree decoding policy over the same draft head.

Standalone GPU training smoke tests for EAGLE-1/EAGLE-2, Domino, and P-EAGLE
are kept under `tests/special_standalone/`. The scheduled/manual
`gpu_drafter_training_smoke` workflow runs them with a configurable target
model, optimizer step count, and learning rate.

Domino is trained with `speculative_algorithm=DOMINO`, but it is served as a
DFlash projector sub-mode. For rollout, use `speculative_algorithm=DFLASH`
with a Domino checkpoint on an engine version that supports the Domino
projector.

P-EAGLE training is available, but its vLLM parallel-drafting rollout runtime
is not wired into this overlay yet. Keep rollout drafter serving disabled and
train or serve the checkpoint separately.

## Runtime Compatibility

The runtime requirements are backend-specific. `REQUIRED_VERL.txt` only pins
the upstream `verl` version; install the matching rollout runtime for the
drafter backend you use.

| Draft model | vLLM | vLLM-Ascend | SGLang |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| EAGLE-1 / EAGLE-2 | Engine version with native EAGLE support | Runtime-specific | - |
| EAGLE3 | &gt;= 0.18.0 | &gt;= 0.18.0 | &gt;= 0.5.10 |
| DFlash | &gt;= 0.20.2 | &gt;= 0.20.2 | &gt;= 0.5.12 |
| DFlash2 | &gt;= 0.28.0 (served as DFlash) | - | [main](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) (served as DFLASH; no tagged release up to 0.5.18) |
| DSpark | GPU: [main](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/tree/main)<br>NPU: [`58d3918`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/tree/58d3918e3ea0a544ffedadad2ba84559e9c51d8f) | NPU: [`6af9257`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/tree/6af9257e449ca139ccd228f0d71ca7d2c09909c9)<br>NPU (MRV2): [`27a9476`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/tree/27a94764b5ead50ed3e42ab52a257c2173032750) | - |
| Domino | DFlash-compatible runtime with Domino projector support | Runtime-specific | Runtime-specific |
| P-EAGLE | Not wired | Not wired | Not wired |

For vLLM DFlash, the drafter checkpoint must use the DFlash draft model config
expected by the runtime.

For vLLM DFlash2, keep `speculative_algorithm=DFLASH2`: the overlay maps it onto
vLLM's DFlash method and the engine picks the DFlash2 draft (dynamic
convolutions plus candidate selector) from the checkpoint's `DFlash2DraftModel`
architecture, so both the drafter training loop and the rollout drafter run
DFlash2. The checkpoint must use the z-lab layout with the DFlash2 knobs under
`dflash_config`; `python -m verl_speco.convert_speculators_dflash2` rewrites a
speculators-format drafter (for example `mgoin/Qwen3-4B-speculator.dflash2`) into
it. vLLM sizes the convolution block as the bonus token plus
`rollout.spec_verify_tokens`, so set `spec_verify_tokens = dflash2_block_size - 1`
(see `examples/run_qwen3-8b_drafter_dflash2_vllm.sh`).

For SGLang DFlash2, also keep `speculative_algorithm=DFLASH2`: the overlay maps
it onto SGLang's DFLASH speculative worker, which builds the DFlash2 modules
from the checkpoint's `DFlash2DraftModel` architecture and `dflash_config`.
This needs an sglang build from main (no tagged release up to 0.5.18 ships the
DFlash2 draft). Note the block contract differs from vLLM: SGLang uses
`spec_verify_tokens` directly as the DFlash block size, so set
`spec_verify_tokens = dflash2_block_size` (8 by default; see
`examples/run_qwen3-8b_drafter_dflash2_sglang.sh`). sglang main also rejects
`return_hidden_states` for the DFLASH worker, so collect the training hidden
states from the old-logprob pass
(`training.collect_hidden_states_from_old_logprob=true`) rather than
`collect_hidden_states_from_sgl`.

For vLLM DSpark on GPU, use vLLM main. The NPU example uses vLLM's V1 engine
with the native vLLM-Ascend ModelRunnerV2 DSpark implementation. The pinned
pair above contains Qwen DSpark MRV2 support, FULL-graph support, and the
scheduler/runtime changes through
[vLLM-Ascend PR #13819](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/13819).
Set `VLLM_USE_V1=1` and `VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER=1`; SpeCo then passes the
native `method=dspark` configuration instead of installing the legacy MRV1
DFlash compatibility patches.

This integration deliberately supports fixed verification length only. Native
MRV2 does not expose the MRV1 confidence-head/dynamic-length contract, so keep
`dspark_confidence_loss_alpha=0`, do not publish confidence-head tensors, and
do not enable dynamic verification length. The MRV1 vLLM path and the standalone
trainer do support confidence-head training: set `dspark_confidence_loss_alpha>0`
(optionally `dspark_confidence_head_with_markov`) to train the per-position
acceptance head against `alpha = sum_v min(p_v, q_v) = 1 - TV`, matching
`speculators`. The Qwen checkpoint must declare
`architectures=["Qwen3DSparkModel"]` and use `sample_from_anchor=true` (or omit
it for the native default); the fixed verification length must not exceed the
checkpoint's training `block_size`.

### VeOmni Actor Compatibility

VeOmni is an actor training engine in this integration; the drafter itself
continues to use SpeCo's FSDP2 trainer. Match Uni-Agent's current source
recommendation when installing VeOmni:

```bash
uv pip install --no-deps "git+https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/VeOmni.git@main"
```

Use `--config-name=speco_veomni_trainer`. The adapter preserves verl's native
VeOmni handling for dense, MoE, and multimodal actors and adds the SpeCo
old-logprob hidden-state and lm-head synchronization paths. Ulysses SP, expert
parallelism, multi-node execution, and router replay remain controlled by
VeOmni/verl settings; for R3, rollout routing replay must also be enabled.

| VeOmni capability | SpeCo integration |
| --- | --- |
| Dense and MoE actor | Supported through verl's VeOmni engine |
| Ulysses SP | Selected hidden rows are merged over the VeOmni SP group |
| Expert parallelism | Preserved; lm-head export avoids expert state-dict materialization |
| Router replay R2 | Preserved through old-logprob and actor update |
| Router replay R3 | Supported when the rollout backend returns `routed_experts` |
| Qwen3-VL / Qwen3-Omni / Qwen3.5 text backbone | Explicit layer and final-norm discovery |
| Multi-node | Uses the distributed groups and Ray ObjectRef routing supplied by verl |

The GPU and NPU entrypoints are
`examples/run_qwen3-8b_drafter_dspark_veomni_vllm.sh` and
`examples/run_qwen3-8b_drafter_dspark_veomni_vllm_npu.sh`. Set
`VEOMNI_SP_SIZE`, `VEOMNI_EP_SIZE`, `VEOMNI_ROUTER_REPLAY_MODE`, `NNODES`,
`ROLLOUT_DP_SIZE`, and `ROLLOUT_EP_SIZE` to select the parallel layout. R3
automatically enables rollout routing replay in these scripts.
The NPU version pair listed in the DSpark compatibility table includes the
vLLM and vLLM-Ascend routed-experts capture path required by R3.

## Installation

Install the upstream `verl` release branch specified in
[`REQUIRED_VERL.txt`](./REQUIRED_VERL.txt), which is mirrored in
[`verl_speco/config/speco_base.yaml`](./verl_speco/config/speco_base.yaml).
By default, unsupported `verl` versions produce a warning. Set
`VERL_SPECO_STRICT_VERL=1` to fail closed when the importable `verl` does not
match either the release/v0.8.0 or release/v0.9.0 API contract. The repository
keeps release/v0.8.0 as the default and CI baseline; release/v0.9.0 is an
additive compatibility path used by native vLLM MRV2 deployments.

One typical editable setup is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verl-project/verl.git
cd verl
git checkout release/v0.8.0  # or release/v0.9.0 for native MRV2
pip install -e .

cd ..
git clone https://github.com/verl-project/verl-SpeCo.git
cd verl-SpeCo
pip install -e .
```

The editable install exposes the `verl_speco` package without modifying
`PYTHONPATH`. It also installs the `verl-speco`, `verl-speco-draft-train`, and
`verl-speco-inspect-features` command-line entry points. Install the matching
GPU or NPU rollout runtime separately; `verl-SpeCo` intentionally does not let
pip replace accelerator-specific PyTorch, vLLM, SGLang, or vLLM-Ascend builds.

### Docker Images

You can also build GPU runtime images from the official `verlai/verl`
development images and then use an importable upstream `verl` checkout from a
supported branch. Separate `docker/verl0.8.0` and `docker/verl0.9.0`
Dockerfiles keep the selected dependency explicit. The Dockerfiles below target
GPU deployments; use the matching accelerator image for NPU or other runtimes.

For GPU vLLM-based examples, use this Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# GPU vLLM runtime image.
FROM verlai/verl:vllm023.dev1

ARG VERL_REF=release/v0.8.0
ARG VERL_REPO=https://github.com/verl-project/verl.git

WORKDIR /workspace

RUN git clone ${VERL_REPO} /workspace/verl \
    && cd /workspace/verl \
    && git checkout ${VERL_REF} \
    && pip install -e .

COPY . /workspace/verl-SpeCo

WORKDIR /workspace/verl-SpeCo
RUN pip install -e .
```

Build it from the `verl-SpeCo` repository root:

```bash
docker build -f docker/verl0.8.0/Dockerfile.vllm \
  -t verl-speco:vllm023-verl080 .
```

For GPU SGLang-based examples, use the same layout with the SGLang base image:

```dockerfile
# GPU SGLang runtime image.
FROM verlai/verl:sgl0512.dev1

ARG VERL_REF=release/v0.8.0
ARG VERL_REPO=https://github.com/verl-project/verl.git

WORKDIR /workspace

RUN git clone ${VERL_REPO} /workspace/verl \
    && cd /workspace/verl \
    && git checkout ${VERL_REF} \
    && pip install -e .

COPY . /workspace/verl-SpeCo

WORKDIR /workspace/verl-SpeCo
RUN pip install -e .
```

Build it from the `verl-SpeCo` repository root:

```bash
docker build -f docker/verl0.8.0/Dockerfile.sglang \
  -t verl-speco:sgl0512-verl080 .
```

For verl 0.9, use the corresponding files under `docker/verl0.9.0`. The Ascend
Dockerfile also defaults to 0.8 and accepts
`--build-arg VERL_REF=release/v0.9.0` for an explicit 0.9 image.

Install the rollout engine and accelerator runtime that match the script you
intend to run, for example vLLM on GPU, SGLang on GPU, or vLLM-Ascend on NPU.
Those runtime packages are intentionally not pinned by this repository.

## Quickstart

Start from one of the example scripts and replace the model, drafter, dataset,
and checkpoint paths:

```bash
bash examples/run_qwen3-8b_drafter_eagle3_vllm.sh
```

For NPU with vLLM-Ascend-style graph settings:

```bash
bash examples/run_qwen3-8b_drafter_eagle3_vllm_npu.sh
```

The vLLM-Ascend examples keep `FULL_DECODE_ONLY` and dense cudagraph capture
sizes in the launch script so graph behavior is explicit.

All examples use the same entrypoint:

```bash
python -m verl_speco.main
```

The main drafter switches are:

```bash
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.drafter.enable=True
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.drafter.enable_drafter_training=True
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.drafter.model_path=/path/to/drafter
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.drafter.speculative_algorithm=EAGLE3
```

## Separate Draft Model Training

verl-SpeCo also supports standalone DSpark draft-model training from a finite
verl-style prompt Parquet or prompt/response JSONL/Parquet file. For prompt-only
rows, a producer asks the target vLLM service to generate the response while
extracting prompt/output hidden states. It transfers each global batch through
TransferQueue, and a consumer trains the drafter independently of PPO.

Quickstart:

```bash
bash examples/run_qwen3-8b_drafter_dspark_separate_training.sh
```

Set the same model, dataset, drafter, checkpoint, GPU, and optimization values
used by ordinary standalone training near the top of the script. Transport
identity, Ray/TQ connection settings, and the Producer/Consumer lifecycle are
derived and managed internally. The target hidden-state vLLM service uses the
local port 8000 convention.

The main mode values are:

| Mode | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `online` | Default. Collects rollout features, trains the drafter inside the online PPO/Ray workflow, and can publish updated drafter weights back to the rollout engine. |
| `collect_only` | Collects rollout features into `feature_store.path` without running drafter training in the PPO/Ray workflow. |
| `offline` | Reads collected features from `feature_store.path` and trains the drafter with the standalone multi-GPU workflow. |

Offline training supports every drafter family the online workers support:
EAGLE-1, EAGLE-2, EAGLE-3, DFlash, DSpark, Domino and P-EAGLE.

DSpark offline training can additionally train the confidence head used for
dynamic draft-length thresholding. Set `dspark_confidence_loss_alpha>0` (for
example `0.2`) and the head is created automatically from the target's final
hidden state; `dspark_confidence_head_with_markov` keeps the Markov previous-token
embedding in the head input (default `true`). A positive value on either
`dspark_confidence_head_alpha` or `dspark_confidence_loss_alpha` enables the head,
while only `dspark_confidence_loss_alpha` weights its BCE term. Training the
confidence head requires the target's final hidden state, so the DSpark hidden
state collection switches to `dflash_aux_plus_last` whenever either it or the L1
loss is enabled. The standalone scripts expose `DSPARK_CONFIDENCE_HEAD_ALPHA`,
`DSPARK_CONFIDENCE_HEAD_WITH_MARKOV`, and `DSPARK_CONFIDENCE_LOSS_ALPHA`.

Domino and P-EAGLE are training-time families with no engine-level speculative
method of their own (engines serve Domino as a DFlash projector sub-mode, and
P-EAGLE needs the parallel-drafting runtime), so the rollout stage collects
features with the engine algorithm whose hidden-state layout they consume, and
the offline stage trains them from that same feature store:

| Drafter to train | Stage 1 `speculative_algorithm` | Feature layout | Stage 2 `speculative_algorithm` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domino | `DFLASH` | `dflash_aux` | `DOMINO` |
| P-EAGLE | `EAGLE3` | `eagle3_aux_plus_last` | `PEAGLE` |

```bash
DRAFT_ALGO=domino bash examples/run_qwen3-8b_drafter_domino_peagle_separate_training.sh
DRAFT_ALGO=peagle bash examples/run_qwen3-8b_drafter_domino_peagle_separate_training.sh
```

Feature stores collected with `speculative_algorithm=DOMINO` before Domino was
mapped to the DFlash layout carry `hidden_states_layout=eagle3_aux_plus_last`
in their sample metadata. DFlash preprocessing fails closed on that layout, so
those stores have to be collected again with `DFLASH`.

Collected feature stores can be inspected before offline training:

```bash
python -m verl_speco.inspect_feature_store /path/to/features \
  --max-samples 200 \
  --show-ok \
  --strict-exit
```

## Configuration

SPECO-specific options live under:

```text
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.drafter.*
```

Important groups:

- `drafter.enable`: enables speculative decoding at rollout time.
- `drafter.enable_drafter_training`: enables online drafter trainer workers.
- `drafter.rollout.*`: controls speculative steps, top-k, and verify tokens.
- `drafter.training.*`: controls hidden-state collection, training interval,
  publish interval, update mode, and DFlash/DSpark-specific training options.
- `drafter.vllm.*`: contains vLLM-specific drafter overrides.

Shared SPECO and drafter defaults are in
[`verl_speco/config/speco_base.yaml`](./verl_speco/config/speco_base.yaml).
The online PPO entrypoint composes them through
[`speco_trainer.yaml`](./verl_speco/config/speco_trainer.yaml), while standalone
feature-store training uses
[`draft_trainer.yaml`](./verl_speco/config/draft_trainer.yaml).

## Testing

CPU-light contract tests can be run with:

```bash
pip install -r ci/requirements-ci.txt
pytest tests
```

Some tests require an upstream `verl` checkout. CI uses release/v0.8.0 from
`REQUIRED_VERL.txt`; the same contracts also recognize a release/v0.9.0
checkout. Set `VERL_SPECO_UPSTREAM_ROOT` to the selected checkout root:

```bash
export VERL_SPECO_UPSTREAM_ROOT=/path/to/verl
pytest tests/config/test_speco_config_overlay.py
```

Hardware smoke tests are kept under `ci/` and are intended for self-hosted GPU
or NPU runners with matching model paths and runtime packages.
